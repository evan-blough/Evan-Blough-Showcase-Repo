These are sample code from a mix of university projects and personal projects.

Unity RPG Project: A solo project started in October 2024 to get experience with game development and to attempt to create a new single-player story driven RPG from scratch. Solo project, ongoing. A build is included, but scripts are only included for the battle system.

Yahtzee Project: Fall 2023 university project between three people to create a working Yahtzee game from scratch as a part of a Intro to Software Engineering course. I worked on the ScoreCard class and its functionalities.
